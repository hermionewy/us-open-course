1,5/4,598/496 yards,"It'll play much easier as a par 5, but it all depends on the wind. As a par 5, everyone should get to the front edge in two. The hardest part of the hole could be the condition of the green, one of two greens that will be too bumpy.",01.jpg,,
2,4,399 yards,"Left of the fairway probably is the healthiest rough on the course. You could actually lose a ball in it. If players hit the fairway, they should be able to score, especially with a back pin. ",,,
3,3,198/163 yards,"The prevailing wind, from the southwest, actually makes it harder to hold this green. You have to use a little bit of the hill on the right side to stop the ball. The trickiest part is the hill, which is so firm now that balls are really kicking off of it hard.",,,
4,4,495 yards,"A lot depends on the hole location. If it's a front pin, a lot of players will play to right side of fairway, but flat lies are rare from there. A back pin will be the hardest, because from the middle it's a 70-foot putt with 15 feet of break.",,,
5,4,488 yards,"Just a long hole, and a lot of players will have at least 200 yards into the green. It's such a big green with so much slope that it's tough to get the ball on the right section. You'll see a lot of putts from 40 to 50 feet. ",,,
6,4,495 yards,"If you have the prevailing wind, this could be the hardest hole. The second shot a lot of times will be 190 yards into the wind to the firmest green, surrounded by bunkers. I can guarantee an above-par average score.",,,
7,4,508 yards,"If it's a prevailing wind, this is not that tough of hole. If the wind comes from the north, though, this could become the hardest hole. They cut the fairway to a third of what it once was, and the green is still one of the hardest to hold, especially from a long distance.",,,
8,5,614 yards,"Brooks Koepka got there in two from 294 yards out, so it's reachable in two from 600-plus yards without wind. There is rough if you miss the fairway. We call the left side the Salad Bar because there is a spring and some of the deepest, wettest rough is there. ",,,
9,3,224/217 yards,"A fun hole. A front pin, you're going to see some holes-in-one. If they miss it left, it's pretty much dead. It's pretty much a 1-in-20 up-and-down. They'd rather be right in the bunker. The lower tee box is definitely harder and generally into the wind. ",09.jpg,4288545114001,Hole9.jpg
10,4,468/436 yards,"They have a really wide landing area off the tee and a really narrow second shot. Second shot is very precise, and you need to hit the front left corner of the green. If they move that up to a drivable par 4, it's really hard to hit because it's so narrow near the green. ",10.jpg,4288529279001,Hole10.jpg
11,4,537/500 yards,"It should be one of the toughest holes on the back nine. A pin on the right side makes it a pretty easy hole. On the left side, it might add a half-stroke to the average score. It's harder to putt on the left and harder to get it anywhere near that pin.",,,
12,4,281 yards,"You should see most players drive the green, then three-putt. It could be an eagle-birdie hole, or a double-bogey hole. One day you might see a front right pin, which will mean a lot of birdies and eagles. The green could be the bumpiest on the course. ",12.jpg,,
13,4,534 yards,"Possibly the hardest hole on the back. Widest fairway in U.S. Open history at more than 100 yards, but you're still hitting 200 yards uphill. You might get the most wind in your face than anywhere else on the course.",,,
14,4,546/521 yards,"One of the most beautiful and fun holes, but also the trickiest and the meanest, especially if they play it back. They should be able to score OK if they can find the fairway, but it's just a tough driving hole.",,,
15,3,246/167/123 yards,"It can play 100 yards different. It could be 145 one day, 245 the next, and if it's into the wind it's playing like 260. The only way to hold it on the green from 245 if there is no wind is to hit it 260 into the back left corner. ",15.jpg,4288618270001,Hole15.jpg
16,4,423 yards,"If it's a north wind, playing downwind, it could be the hardest hole on the course. Holding that green downwind is almost impossible. Into the wind, it's fairly easy. The green is always firm, and there are not any flat spots.",16.jpg,4288545113001,Hole16.jpg
17,3,218/172 yards,"Probably will be the hardest par 3. A pin on the right is just too dangerous. Front and middle sections are fairly gettable. Anytime the pin is on the right or if there is any kind of wind, then it's a really tough hole. ",,,
18,4/5,525/604 yards,"As a par 5, it's an easy hole, except for the green. As a par 4, there is so much more thinking involved, and there is so much more happening that it demands so much more out of you. The green complex could be the hardest on the course.",18.jpg,4288545111001,Hole18.jpg
